        <h4> Did you ever asked yourself how do<em> social media platforms</em> work?</h4>
        <p>
            What is behind the mechanism that make us consume personalized content based on our past preferences and choices?   
        </p>
        <p>
            That is provided to the user by specific designed algorithms, and here in this brief informational article,
        we're gonna break down this algorithms so we can understand <strong>how they work.</strong> 
        </p>
          
        <p>
         Sound like a complicated concept, and it is kind of complex, so let's start start with the basics. <strong>What is an algorithm?
        And what are the use of them in social media?</strong> </p> <blockquote>"In computing, algorithms provide computers with a successive guide to completing actions. 
        Theyâ€™re comprised of a precise list of instructions that outline exactly how to complete a task."</blockquote>
        <p> An algorithm is a digital recipe: 
        a list of rules for achieving an outcome, using a set of ingredients. 
        </p>
        <p><img src="http://imgfz.com/i/tK3YUer.jpeg"></p>

        <p>In social media, these algorithms are usually written by programmers
                who use <em> machine learning </em>. "Machine learning" is a term that means algorithms 
               "learn" how to perform certain tasks.
                Algorithms perform multiple tasks simultaneously that would be tedious
               for humans to do, such as managing content streams
               through active recommendations as well as negative<em> shadow bans </em>and
                mediating interaction with information through likes and comments
                to improve content discoverability.</p>
        
        <p>
        The function of an algorithm is to deliver relevant content to users.
         The reason social media platforms use algorithms is to more organically filter  the large amount of content available on each platform. Algorithms do the work of delivering content that is potentially more "interesting" to auser, to the detriment of posts that are deemed irrelevant or inferior - either in general or to a specific user.
        </p>
        <p><img src="https://digivizer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/algorithms-blogheader-1024x536-1.png.webp"></p>
        
        <p>
        Without algorithms on social media, the common user would not be provided with personalized content, which would likely cause the user to continue searching for their desired content, wasting valuable time. Moreover, algorithms vary their behavior depending on the platform and the content displayed there, as they are programmed with different goals in mind; some platforms give more importance to Likes, others to comments, and so on,  again depending on the platform's goals and content.
        </p>
        
        <h4>So now that we know how social media algorithms are built, and the purpose they were made for, we can now discuss some of the controversy and ethical issues implied with them.</h4>
        
        <p><img class="small image" id="smart_thumbnail" src="https://wrcb.images.worldnow.com/images/19042780_G.gif?lastEditedDate=1576747263000"></p>
        <p>
        Such controversies often involve privacy issues: algorithms work with a social media user's personal data to "know" how content should be displayed on the social media platform (for example, algorithms use sensitive data such as the user's geographic location, the friends and acquaintances they interact with most, the pages and hashtags they frequently search for, etc.). Similarly, there are considerations  of how algorithms influence the opinions and interests of social media users and, by extension, digital society. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Through the use of shadow bans, algorithms can lead to information 
        gaps by hiding or neglecting certain posts while prioritizing
         revenue-generating content. This aspect of algorithmic design
          is controversial as it claims to determine what content users
           should find important or valuable. This can lead to non-objective
            and polarized decisions about who and what gets the spotlight.
         As a result,algorithmic design inevitably influences the
             dissemination of culture and shapes digital society in a 
             particular way: It decides whatkind of content or topics 
             should be prioritized in each feed, and which artists,
             content creators, or brands deserve to gain more visibility than
             others.

        <p>I invite you to our<a href="Tweets.html"> Tweets and Discussion</a> section, where you
            can get more perspective seeing tweets. You can comment in our
            Disqus aswell.
            Or you could also visit the<a href="Sources.html"> Sources</a> section, where you can get
            more information and see the sources I consulted for this article.
